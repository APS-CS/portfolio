# Project: "Web Application Penetration Testing/Security Assesment Report"

This project was part of the Application Security course, focusing on conducting ethical hacking exercises on web applications within the PortSwigger lab platform. The assignment simulated a real-world penetration test (pentest), enabling students to identify, exploit and document security vulnerabilities in a structured and professional manner.

## Project Objectives: 
- Perform a penetration test of web applications to uncover common vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, authentication weaknesses, and security misconfigurations.
- Document the findings in a comprehensive pentest report, including technical details and actionable recommendations for remediation.
- Develop hands-on expertise in using Burp Suite and other tools to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities.
- Enhance understanding of secure coding practices and how to prevent vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

## Deliverables:
* Pentest Report:
  - Detailed documentation of vulnerabilities identified during the testing process, including:
    - Injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, Command Injection).
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
    - Insecure Deserialization and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
  - Recommendations for mitigation, referencing industry best practices such as OWASP Top 10 and secure development guidelines.

* Ethical Hacking Exercises:
  - Practical exploitation of web application vulnerabilities using tools like BurpSuite.
  - Simulated attacks to demonstrate real-world risks while maintaining ethical boundaries.

## Key Learning Outcomes
* Technical Expertise:
  - Hands-on experience in vulnerability identification, exploitation, and reporting.
  - Use of professional tools like Burp Suite to simulate attacks and assess risks.

* Structured Reporting:
  - Ability to create a professional penetration testing report with technical findings, prioritized risks, and actionable recommendations.

* Secure Development Awareness:
  - Insights into preventing vulnerabilities through secure coding practices, proper authentication mechanisms, and secure API implementations.

* Problem-Solving Skills:
  - Application of systematic methodologies to identify vulnerabilities, analyze root causes, and propose solutions that align with organizational security needs.
